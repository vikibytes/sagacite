### My notes on the MITx Intro to Probability Course

Each folder has notes and code associated with that corresponding unit.
- The notes can be found in the files named "Notes*.md"
- Some of the units contain code in Jupyter notebooks. Just open any files with the .ipynb extension and Github should render them.
