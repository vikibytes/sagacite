# Independence of events

## General Idea 

- If I tell you that a certain event A has occurred, this
will generally change the probability of some other
event B. Probabilities will have to be replaced by
conditional probabilities.

But if the conditional probability turns out to be
the same as the unconditional probability, then the
occurrence of event A does not carry any useful information
on whether event B will occur.

In such a case, we say that events A and B are
independent.

- Intuitive definition = P(B | A) = P(B) i.e., occurence of A provides no new information about B.

- In this case, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B | A) = P(A) P(B).

- Formal Definition of Independence = P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B)
    - Symmetric with respect to A and B
    - implies P(A | B) = P(A)
    - applies even if P(A) = 0

- Independence is a relation about information

- If A and B are independent, then A and B` are also independent.

- Conditional Independence : P(A ∩ B | C) = P(A | C) P(B | C)

- Conditioning affects Independence. Therefore be sure to check the conditioning event.

- Independence of a collection of events : P(A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3 ∩ A4 ∩ A5 ∩ ...An) = P(A1) P(A2) P(A3) ... P(An)
