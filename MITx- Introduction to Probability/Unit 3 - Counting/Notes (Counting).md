## Counting 

- Counting is useful because we often want to count the entire sample space and our event of interest. Many a times they can be large and it is useful to know some basic combinatorics.

- **The Counting Principle** : The total number of possible results of the r-stage process is n1 * n2 * n3 * ... n<sub>r</sub>.

- For e.g., to order an ice cream we have to choose from 2 cone types, 12 flavors and 7 toppings. So the total number of ways to order an ice cream is 2 * 12 * 7

- **Summary of Counting Results** 
    - **Permutations** of n objects: n!
    - **k-permutations** of n objects: n! / (n - k)!
    - **Combinations** of k out of n objects: n choose k = n! / k! (n - k)!
    - **Partitions** of n objects into r groups, with the i<sub>th</sub> group having n<sub>i</sub> objects:
