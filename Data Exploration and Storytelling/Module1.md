# Visualization for Discovery

## Overview

- Visual Encoding : Mapping data to proportional visual objects (lines, areas, widths, heights, angles, colors.)

- Data Visualization enables you to see the potential stories behind the numbers. (Example: Is 72 / 100 a better or worse score than 96 / 137)

- A 'hockey-stick' visualization was shown to prove that global warming is true (IPCC Third Report, 2001)

## Finding Data

- Open Data

- Google
    - Use file type extensions like xls, csv to search for data
    - Do image searches on data topics you are working on

- Try to read through metadata to find what topics are important in your area of research

- Publications like NYTimes, The Guardian

- Data vendors lik ProPublica, Enigma, Dataverse

- Read Reports (hidden data in the PDF files)

- Scraping (import.io, openjournalism)
    - be wary of legal and ethical implications
    - check robots.txt of the sites to see which parts are allowed to be scraped
